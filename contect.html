			My name is zain bilal .I love gaming especially in the IT world, encourage multiplayer video gaming as a team building activity and as a way to de-stress. If you're aiming for a job in tech, noting gaming as a personal interest could prove beneficial. and also i am a travel person exhibiting a desire to experience new cultures and environments especially if your role would involve working with foreign colleagues, partners or clients can really help your resume shine. and when i am free then i love to listen music This can include everything from instruments you may play, to DJ ing, to being an avid concertgoer, to simply being a passionate fan of a specific genre. You can get creative with categories like this. For instance, if you're in the process of learning to play the violin, use this as an example of your perseverance and willingness to learn new skills.
